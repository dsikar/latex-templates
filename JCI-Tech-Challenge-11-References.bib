abstract="With an ever-increasing amount of options, the task of selecting machine learning tools for big data can be difficult. The available tools have advantages and drawbacks, and many have overlapping uses. The world's data is growing rapidly, and traditional tools for machine learning are becoming insufficient as we move towards distributed and real-time processing. This paper is intended to aid the researcher or professional who understands machine learning but is inexperienced with big data. In order to evaluate tools, one should have a thorough understanding of what to look for. To that end, this paper provides a list of criteria for making selections along with an analysis of the advantages and drawbacks of each. We do this by starting from the beginning, and looking at what exactly the term ``big data'' means. From there, we go on to the Hadoop ecosystem for a look at many of the projects that are part of a typical machine learning architecture and an understanding of how everything might fit together. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of three different processing paradigms along with a comparison of engines that implement them, including MapReduce, Spark, Flink, Storm, and H2O. We then look at machine learning libraries and frameworks including Mahout, MLlib, SAMOA, and evaluate them based on criteria such as scalability, ease of use, and extensibility. There is no single toolkit that truly embodies a one-size-fits-all solution, so this paper aims to help make decisions smoother by providing as much information as possible and quantifying what the tradeoffs will be. Additionally, throughout this paper, we review recent research in the field using these tools and talk about possible future directions for toolkit-based learning.",

abstract = "It is a striking fact that in humans the greatest learning occurs precisely at that point in time - childhood - when the most dramatic maturational changes also occur. This report describes possible synergistic interactions between maturational change and the ability to learn a complex domain (language), as investigated in connectionist networks. The networks are trained to process complex sentences involving relative clauses, number agreement, and several types of verb argument structure. Training fails in the case of networks which are fully formed and ‘adultlike’ in their capacity. Training succeeds only when networks begin with limited working memory and gradually ‘mature’ to the adult state. This result suggests that rather than being a limitation, developmental restrictions on resources may constitute a necessary prerequisite for mastering certain complex domains. Specifically, successful learning may depend on starting small."

    abstract = {{We introduce a novel approach for automatically classifying the sentiment of Twitter messages. These messages are classified as either positive or negative with respect to query term. This is useful for consumers who want to research the sentiment of products before purchase, or com-panies that want to monitor the public sentiment of theirbrands. There is no previous research on classifying sen-timent of messages on microblogging services like Twitter.We present the results of machine learning algorithms forclassifying the sentiment of Twitter messages using distantsupervision. Our training data consists of Twitter messageswith emoticons, which are used as noisy labels. This type oftraining data is abundantly available and can be obtainedthrough automated means. We show that machine learn-ing algorithms (Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and SVM)have accuracy above 80\% when trained with emoticon data.This paper also describes the preprocessing steps needed inorder to achieve high accuracy. The main contribution ofthis paper is the idea of using tweets with emoticons fordistant supervised learning.}},
