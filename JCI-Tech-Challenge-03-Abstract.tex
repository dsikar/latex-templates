AI (Artificial Intelligence) presents both opportunities and challenges for the enterprise. While there are technical barriers to overcome in order to harness the power and enjoy the benefits of time and cost efficiencies to be gained, there is the threat from other early adopters attaining competitive advantages detrimental to our own interests. To adequately handle this threat-opportunity scenario, a pro-active approach is required. The authors briefly describe AI concepts, applications and historical perspective, and go on to and propose a pilot scheme to be implemented in Research and Development units, that will provide management with knowledge to make informed decisions on determining AI roadmaps, with costs already built-in to current overheads.
